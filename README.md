# TeamTemplate

hey ria! i added "ria.html". you can make a copy, make any changes and upload it on your side whenever you're ready. hopefully it works! i also changed the file path to "ria.html" instead of "Ria.html" in the index.html file. I think your "Ria.html" was a copy of the home page so it was not showing up with the right format.

i copy and pasted our link (https://riadubey.github.io/339week2/) and it looks like it's working!
